## Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

*   Edit `data/config.yaml` to define:
    *   `simulation_params`: `num_games`, `innings_per_game`, `output_log_file`.
    *   `lineup`: A list of 9 players, each with a `name` and a `stats` dictionary containing the required metrics (plate\_appearances, at\_bats, hits, doubles, etc.).

## Usage

*   Run the simulation from the `baseball_simulator` root directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
*   Simulation results, including play-by-play logs and final scores, will be saved in the `logs/` directory (default: `simulation_results.yaml`).

## Notes & Future Improvements

*   This simulation focuses solely on the batting team's performance. Opposing pitching and defense are not factored in.
*   Baserunning logic is simplified (e.g., basic GIDP handling, no stolen base attempts during the simulation, simple XBP application).
*   Does not currently model situational hitting (e.g., sacrifice bunts/flies explicitly).
*   Could be extended to include pitching stats, fielding errors, more complex baserunning decisions (tagging up, hit-and-run), weather effects, etc.
*   Add calculation and tracking of more detailed game stats (box score).
